* RTC-base



* Ideas:
	* procedurally generated mines as dungeon-adj thingy? :3
	* level from mining, farming, woodcutting, ...
		* the precursor to clicker games way before their time :D:

	* tree stock maintenance?

		* do we require user intervention for certain kinds of tree which struggle to strive in areas?
	* crafting?
