## Stranded II

## Item Preview

It is sort of hard to put Stranded II into a category of genres. This is more of a survival game than it is a RPG, but we are close enough.  
  
If you liked the movie Castaway, chances are you will like this too. If you liked the TV-series Lost, then chances are you will love this.  
  
On a bright shiny day you take your yacht out for a cruise of the oceans, to relax and kick back, but underway you sail right into a terrible storm, which wrecks your ship and sends you into the water.  
  
As you open your eyes you find you are swimming off an island which seems deserted. This is where the game begins. Your task now is to survive on the island, and try to get back to your own life any way possible. You build up skills to help you get better at surviving. You can plant berry bushes, corn and even trees to help you create a living on the deserted island. You can fish or hunt for food, and dig for roots, mushrooms, worms etc. There are a handful of skills that will come in handy.  
  
You can build different buildings that will also help you survive or at least make your living better.  
  
There is also an editor for the survivalist that likes to create their own island paradise or hell.  
  
You can decide to either explore everything on your own or you can get the Stranded II Game Guide done by me just a little further down on this site.  
  
No matter what this game is a masterpiece, and if you played Stranded I then you will be amazed at the options of Stranded II.
