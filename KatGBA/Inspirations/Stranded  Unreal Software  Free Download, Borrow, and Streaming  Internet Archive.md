## Stranded

## Item Preview

Stranded is a 3D survival adventure. You play a guy who is stranded and your aim is to escape from this lonely desert island.  
But this isn't as easy as it sounds. Without any knowledge how to create tools and weapons, without any food and water, but with a lot of wild lions just waiting for you to get near, will you even survive long enough to see the next morning?  
  
Stranded features:  
  
\* Huge islands  
\* A lot of animals and plants  
\* Many different items  
\* 7 buildable buildings/vehicles  
\* 10 weapons/tools  
\* Day and night cycle  
\* Map editor  
  
Once you have finished the game and there is nothing new to explore, there are also some special missions you can try.  
  
P.S.: There is a translation bug in the English version of the game. When you talk to the old guy, he will offer you some items for sale. You should buy both nets, one of them is in fact an axe...
