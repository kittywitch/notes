### YouTube

* Create a list of YouTubers and attempt to maintain a local-first workflow for consuming their content with synchronization for new videos.

### Anime

* Watch more.

### Reading

* Obtain digital copy of Surely You're Joking Mr Feynman!
* Transfer current reading IRL and media list to-reads, act upon them.
