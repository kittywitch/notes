* Notes
** Dailies
   For all of the daily hearts, remember to buy the items from the heart merchant when done.
   - Ember Bay has a renown heart that is easy to do, and a vista. Use LS3 portal tome.
   - For Cantha heart/vista, go to Arborstone via the portal scroll and then teleport to the Monestary Waypoint [&BL8MAAA=], there is a vista nearby at the gate and then travel by foot to the Training Grounds. The JP (doable once daily) and the event provide great contribution to that heart.
   - For Janthir heart/vista, Autumn's Vale Waypoint [&BC4PAAA=] has the events "Catch and collect the flying fish", "Defeat the drake matriarch before she steals any fish" and "Prepare fish before they rot". These provide great contribution to the heart. There is also a vista nearby.
